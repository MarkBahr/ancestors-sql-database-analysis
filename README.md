# SQL Data Analysis for Genealogy

SQL data analysis for family history data with tasks related to data wrangling (cleaning, and structuring), data analysis and visualizations using Tableau. The data is from a ficticious genealogist who desires to have additional data storage and data analysis for his clients.

The project folders follow the following format:

#### Data Wrangling

- Data cleaning, which includes the raw data and SQL files to create a database, import the data, clean the data, and splitting date and location data into multiple columns
- Data Structure, which includes ER diagram and the SQL files to create the storage tables and insert the cleaned data.

#### Data Analysis

- Analyze the data by finding summary statistics, and trends.
- Gain the answers to important or interesting questions. For example, which country is home for the greatest number of your ancestors? Even getting simple answers from data that is organized into separate tables can require complex joins and subqueries. For example, one of the most complex queries I wrote so far is the query that returns a list of the names of a each ancestor's along with the names of their parents and grandparents.
